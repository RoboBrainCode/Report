\section{CONCLUSIONS}

The current work gives a proof of concept of how different robotic modules can be combined and can be learned together via a single feedback rather than individual feedback for every module. The feedback captured is weak in the sense that user does not demonstrate the optimal output. Also the feedback obtained is richer as the user provides a feedback on the end result of the model and is not affected but the individual modules. We also demonstrate how such feedback can learn independent modules with much less examples to achieve performace similar to the expert system. The model can be easily extended to include more number of modules in the pipeline and learn all of them simultaneously. In the future, we aim to design an efficient metric to evalute performance of the entire robotic system which can be used to capture corelation of different modules and backpropagate the feedback rather than distributing it.
