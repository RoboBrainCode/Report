\section{Discussion}
here goes discussion on the results.
Discussion done in 3 paragraphs.
Paragraph1:
analysis of the current results and why the joint system results differ from the independent system with joint feedback

Paragraph2:
what can be done to improve the current system, improve baseline
improve heuristic function
improve the topk space

Paragraph3:
what else can be done:
devising a function end system utility function.
An idea linear combination of the entire system and then learn the weights using coactive feedback
learn independent modules using back propagation
increasing number of modules in the pipeline include vision and manipulation as well
