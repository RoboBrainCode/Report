\section{PROBLEM FORMULATION}

We may use Markov decision process or a latent variable which tells where the
system fails. Once we have some idea on where the system fails, we may update
the parameters accordingly. 
We need to figure out how to quantify the gradients given this information of
the feedback.

\subsection{Algorithm:}
Maths yet to be figured out.
