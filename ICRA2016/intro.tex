\section{INTRODUCTION}

In a joint end-to-end system many robotic tasks fail.  \\

Real-life systems fail, failure is expensive. Obtaining expert feedback is
tough.
Therefore crowd-sourced approaches are useful. Detailed feedback is difficult to
give. With weak like-dislike feedback notable improvements can be shown in the
end-to-end system.  \\

With our algorithm, we can get significant improvement in end to end system. \\

Our experiments show that we can converge to expert feedback system and we fixed
this particular aspect of the system.
