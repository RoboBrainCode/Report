\subsection{Dataset}
Our dataset consists of 30 high level natural language instructions taken using a \href{http://52.25.65.189:9000/#/getFeedback}{crowd sourcing system}. The instructions are taken for 16 different environments depicting scenes similar to living room, bedroom and kitchen. \\
The environments are constructed in OpenRAVE with context generating from 6 different human activities depicted by skeletals. The activities considered are walking, watching, interacting, reaching, sitting and working. \\
The instructions involve task description for themes in common house-hold enviromnent like cleaning the room, arranging the guest room and serving coffee. The dataset contains considerable high level instructions like distribute, arrange etc. with variety in verbs.\\
We filtered out 2 datapoints containing instructions which were very high level and uncertain even for  humans. Of the 30 valid datapoints, 16 are used for training and 14 are used for testing purposes.
