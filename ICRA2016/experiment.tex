Our dataset consists 30 high level natural language instructions taken using a \href{http://52.25.65.189:9000/#/getFeedback}{crowd sourcing system}. The instructions are taken for 16 different environments depicting scenes similar to living room, bedroom and kitchen. \\
The environments are constructed in OpenRAVE with context generating from 6 different human activities depicted by skeletals. The activities considered are walking, watching, interacting, reaching, sitting and working. \\
The instructions involve instructions for themes in common home enviromnent like cleaning the room, arranging the guest room and serving coffee. The dataset contains considerable high level instructions distribute, arrange etc. with variety in verbs.\\
We filtered out 2 datapoints containing instructions which were very high level and uncertain for even  humans. Of the 30 valid datapoints, 16 are used for training and 14 are used for testing purposes.
