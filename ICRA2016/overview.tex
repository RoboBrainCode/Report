\section{Problem Overview}

Any end-to-end robotic system consist of modules which are designed for specific
ability such as grasping, path planning, language understanding etc. These
modelus are attached in cascade to achieve a specific task end-to-end. In this
work we address the question of learning such end-to-end systems in an
interactive manner with a human-in-the-loop. We further want the interactive
learning procedure to be easy for any non-expert user to use. Our motivation
being that a non-expert use is typically agnostic to the modules involved in any
end-to-end robotic system, hence such users cannot mannually tune each module to
achieve the deriersed final behaviour.    

\section{System Overview}



System consists of web based interface where user can see the robotic tasks
executed for a particular NLP instruction. User can give their like and dislike
over this output. User can provide more detailed expert feedback upon it and it
can be used to evaluate our system.
