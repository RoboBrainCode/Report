Designing systems which combine different robotic tasks (e.g., language and planning) is challenging problem. Most robotics project perform particular task and are difficult to combine and generalise across different environments , they even require different kinds of human involvement like hand crafting features and/or different feedback mechanisms.
We aim at building such a joint systems where the entire system can be improved by single weak feedback mechanism on the joint system. The feedback is given on the end-to-end system rather than the individual systems.
Experiments show that we can achieve performance close to the expert systems via much simpler feedback and using much less examples.
